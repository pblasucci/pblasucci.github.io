Growing a Gilded Rose, Bonus 1: F# All the Things!
===

This is part five of six in the series, [_Growing a Gilded Rose_][0]. Over the
course of these six blog posts, I hope to demonstrate incrementally improving
a legacy code base which has thorny requirements, while also presenting a few
different software development tools or concepts. The full series is as follows:

1. [Make it Testable][1]
1. [Next Year's Model][2]
1. [When Worlds Collide][3]
1. [A New Requirement Appears][4]
1. **Bonus: F# All the Things!**  (this post)
1. [Bonus: Meh... C# Can Do That, Too][6]

Growing a Gilded Rose, Part 4: A New Requirement Appears
===

This is part four of six in the series, _Growing a Gilded Rose_. Over the
course of these six blog posts, I hope to demonstrate incrementally
introducing many new concepts while extending a legacy code base which has
thorny requirements. The full series is as follows:

0. [Growing a Gilded Rose][0]
1. [Make it Testable][1]
1. [Next Year's Model][2]
1. [When Worlds Collide][3]
1. **A New Requirement Appears** (this post)
1. [Bonus: F# All the Things!][5]
1. [Bonus: Meh... C# Can Do That, Too][6]

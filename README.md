This repository contains the content and support files for my personal weblog. I follow a simple three-stage writing
workflow (described here, _mostly_, so I don't forget the details). The three stages are as follows:

1.  _Draft_... Heavy on creative flow; light on structure/editing/proofing/presentation/etc.
1.  _Ready_... Thoughts crystallized; focus is on editing, proofing, and presentation.
1.  _Final_... Content is published; no changes (barring editorial corrections).

Each stage of the workflow has an associated folder in the repository. These folders will contain artifacts as follows:

Stage   | Folder    | Content
--------|-----------|--------------------------
Draft   | `./draft` | Markdown files
Ready   | `./ready`  | A mix of HTML files and media (JPG, PNG, SVG, etc.)
Final   | `./docs`   | A mix of HTML files, media (JPG, PNG, SVG, etc.), and styling (CSS)

Finally, a small Powershell script, `Move-Content.ps1`, is provider to facilitate moving between stages.

`TODO document high-level usage of Move-Content.ps1`

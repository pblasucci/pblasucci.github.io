<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Welcome back to the never-ending blog series! ðŸ˜‚ You'd think, by now, we could
move on from the <a href="https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose" target="_blank">Gilded Rose Kata</a>. But no, there's one more &ldquo;riff&rdquo; I'd
like to spin. <a href="https://github.com/NotMyself" target="_blank">Bobby Johnson</a>, who actually first put
the kata up on GitHub.com, once opined that working the kata in a language other
than C# will <a href="http://iamnotmyself.com/2012/12/08/why-most-solutions-to-gilded-rose-miss-the-bigger-picture/" target="_blank">&ldquo;miss the bigger picture&rdquo;</a>. Further, one hears a lot about all
the new features recently added to .NET's primary language. So, with these as
motivating factors, let's see how it looks to build things in &ldquo;modern C#&rdquo;!</p>
<aside>
<h4 id="pick-a-version.any-version">Pick a Version. Any Version?</h4>
<p>The code presented here will target the latest <em>official</em> version of C# (at
time of writing): <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history#c-version-90" target="_blank">version 9</a>. However, C# 10 is due to be released in
several weeks (give or take a few days). Fortunately, only one new feature of
version 10 is relevant to the code under review. Further, there are still
kinks and gaps in wide installation and tooling support for C# 10. So, in an
effort to keep the &ldquo;reach&rdquo; of this article fairly broad, we will stay with
version 9. Perhaps, in a few months time, an updated version of this blog
post may be released (or not ðŸ˜›).</p>
</aside>
<p>You can see the final state-of-affairs in the <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose" target="_blank">companion repository</a>, under
a branch called <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/tree/4_extended" target="_blank"><code>4_extended</code></a> (and if you haven't yet read the previous
entries in the series, now is a good time to get caught up). However, it turns
out a bit more fun can yet be eked out of this activity. Up until now, we've been operating under some fairly specific constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the legacy program</li>
<li>Don't mess with the <code>GildedRose.Item</code> class or the <code>Program.Items</code> field</li>
</ul>
<p>But let's play a bit of <em>What If...</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Management at the Gilded Rose Inn has been really impressed with all the
changes. And just this week, the Goblin in the Corner announced he's retiring
(after 107! years of loyal service) to his condominium in Boca Raton, where he
hopes to play shuffleboard and work on model ship building. So, you've been
given the go-ahead to take full ownership of the inventory program, going
&ldquo;all in&rdquo; on modern C#.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plan then, is to translate the source of the <code>GildedRose.Inventory</code> project.
We will directly include said translations in the <code>GildedRose</code> console
application project, removing any unneeded bits as we progress. The test suite
will also need to change. The old (F#) test suite will be discarded, and each
test recreated in C#. As this is a fairly mechanical process, we will not
explore the test suite as part of this blog post. However, the curious reader
is encouraged to browse <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/6_model-cs/source/GildedRose.Test" target="_blank">the new test suite</a> at their leisure.</p>
<h3 id="model-anatomy">Model Anatomy</h3>
<p>From a structural perspective, the C# console application project should
ultimately have the following five files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/6_model-cs/source/GildedRose/KnownItems.cs" target="_blank"><code>KnownItems.cs</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/6_model-cs/source/GildedRose/Program.cs" target="_blank"><code>Program.cs</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/6_model-cs/source/GildedRose/Quality.cs" target="_blank"><code>Quality.cs</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/6_model-cs/source/GildedRose/InventoryItem.cs" target="_blank"><code>InventoryItem.cs</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/6_model-cs/source/GildedRose/Inventory.cs" target="_blank"><code>Inventory.cs</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The first of these files <em>already exists</em>, and is merely some useful
constant values (the names of some well-know inventory items). The <code>Program.cs</code>
file also already exists. However, as we will see later, it is subject to heavy
revision. The remaining three files comprise the model we've adapted from the
now-discarded F# project.</p>
<p>However, before we dive into the code, let's consider some of the <em>qualities</em> of
the F# model, and how they might be surfaced in C#. There are three things that
really &ldquo;stand out&rdquo; in the F# model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is immutable; operations return a new instance.</li>
<li>Data is separated from behavior.</li>
<li>Behavior is a transition from one state (input) to another (output).</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting: the third quality flows somewhat naturally from the first two.
Further, <em>it is the combining of all three of these qualities together which
holds the actual interest and utility</em>. Fortunately, C# has sufficient tools to
help us preserve these aspects of the model. The following table breaks down
the various elements of the model and how each is realized in F# and C#:</p>

<h4 id="primitives">Primitives</h4>
<p>The model's &ldquo;value objects&rdquo; (the top two items in the previous table), are very
similar between F# and C#. In fact, <code>MagicQuality</code> contains only superficial
syntactic differences. <code>Quality</code>, meanwhile, does require more code in C# than
in F#. Specifically, the use of a record in the F# model gives rise to
<a href="https://www.craigstuntz.com/posts/2020-03-09-equality-is-hard.html" target="_blank">&ldquo;structural semantics&rdquo;</a> for free. These semantics are very important for
natural usage of the type. So, the C# version explicitly implements a few
interfaces (<code>IEquatable&lt;Quality&gt;</code>, <code>IComparable&lt;Quality&gt;</code>) and some overrides
(<code>Equals</code>, <code>GetHashCode</code>), in order to provide the same behavior. Fortunately,
that code is fairly &ldquo;boiler plate&rdquo;. In fact, many modern development tools can
automatically generate the necessary code. So, in the interest of space, we
won't repeat it here. However, it <em>is</em> worth looking at the domain-specific
parts of <code>Quality</code>. Specifically, the code for creation, addition, and
subtraction are as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">/// The value of a Ordinary item (n.b. constrained within: 0 .. 50, inclusive).
public readonly struct Quality
    : IEquatable&lt;Quality&gt;, IComparable&lt;Quality&gt;, IComparable
{
    private readonly byte value;

    /// Constructs a Quality from the given value
    /// (n.b. overlarge inputs are capped at Quality.MaxValue
    /// and undervalued inputs are lifted to Quality.MinValue).
    public Quality(int value)
    {
        this.value = (byte) Min(Max(value, 0), 50);
    }

    /// Defines an explicit conversion of a Quality to an signed 32-bit integer.
    public static explicit operator int(Quality quality) =&gt; quality.value;

    /* ... other functionality elided ... */

    /// Overloaded addition operator
    public static Quality operator +(Quality left, Quality right)
    {
        var sum = left.value + right.value;
        return sum &lt; left.value ? MaxValue : new Quality(sum);
    }

    /// Overloaded subtraction operator
    public static Quality operator -(Quality left, Quality right)
    {
        var dif = left.value - right.value;
        return left.value &lt; dif ? MinValue : new Quality(dif);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In comparison to the <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/4_extended/source/GildedRose.Inventory/Inventory.fs#L7" target="_blank">F# version</a>, the major differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of a constructor rather than a static method for instantiation.</li>
<li>Conversion from/into an <code>int</code> rather than a <code>byte</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these simply reflect stylistic norms, which differ between the two
programming language communities. However, the use of <code>int</code> as an input means
that, in C#, construction of <code>Quality</code> instances have to check for both <em>high</em>
and <em>low</em> boundary violation (see line 12, above). Meanwhile, the F# code can
get away with only checking the <em>high</em> end (since it takes <code>byte</code> inputs and
the minimum value for a <code>byte</code> is the same for a <code>Quality</code> instance), as shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">[&lt;Struct&gt;]
type Quality =
  (* ... other functionality elided ... *)
  static member Of(value) = { Value = min value 50uy }
</code></pre>
<h4 id="inventory">Inventory</h4>
<p>Moving on from the primitives, we come to the most significantly different part
of the C# model: representing the actual inventory items. In the F# version, we
used a single type -- a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/discriminated-unions" target="_blank">discriminated union</a> -- to represent all possible
<a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/4_extended/source/GildedRose.Inventory/Inventory.fs#L32" target="_blank">variations of stock</a>. As C# does not have a similar construct, we must
take a different approach.</p>
<aside>
<h4 id="no-unions-like-none">No Unions? Like, None?!</h4>
<p>Very technically, there exist techniques for encoding a &ldquo;closed hierarchy&rdquo; of
types in C#, such that you effectively arrive something like a discriminated
union. Further, there are third-party libraries which help to ameliorate the
rather significant volume of code required. However, there remains some debate
in the larger community about where and when to best employ such tools. So,
in the interest of keeping this article a bit more focused, we have chosen to
eschew such tools. However, the curious reader is welcome to review the
following materials:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/discriminated-unions.md" target="_blank">C# Language Proposal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5283059/87466" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mcintyre321/OneOf" target="_blank">The OneOf Library</a></li>
</ul>
</aside>
<p>We define a separate <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record" target="_blank">record</a> for each possible kind of item. Each type
carries all the data needed for that particular inventory variant. Further,
each type has a 1:1 correspondence with the cases of the discriminated union
defined in the F# model.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">/// An item with a constant value and no &quot;shelf life&quot;.
public sealed record Legendary(string Name, MagicQuality Quality = default) : IInventoryItem;

/// An item whose value decreases as its &quot;shelf life&quot; decreases.
public sealed record Depreciating(string Name, Quality Quality, int SellIn) : IOrdinary;

/// An item whose value increases as its &quot;shelf life&quot; decreases.
public sealed record Appreciating(string Name, Quality Quality, int SellIn) : IOrdinary;

/// An item whose value is subject to complex, &quot;shelf life&quot;-dependent rules.
public sealed record BackstagePass(string Name, Quality Quality, int SellIn) : IOrdinary;

/// Similar to a &quot;Depreciating&quot; item, but deteriorates twice as quickly.
public sealed record Conjured(string Name, Quality Quality, int SellIn) : IOrdinary;
</code></pre>
<p>We also define two interfaces, each of which extracts some common subset of
properties across all the different record types. Note that neither interface
is required. However, <code>IInventoryItem</code> gives us an easy way to bundle together
many different instances (e.g. in an array). Meanwhile, <code>IOrdinary</code>, when used
in conjunction with pattern matching, greatly simplifies working with
non-<code>Legendary</code> items (which make up the majority of the actual inventory).</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">/// Tracks the name of any inventory.
public interface IInventoryItem
{
    /// The name of a piece of inventory.
    string Name { get; }
}

/// Tracks any inventory which has both a value and a &quot;shelf life&quot;.
public interface IOrdinary : IInventoryItem
{
    /// The value of a piece of inventory.
    Quality Quality { get; }

    /// The &quot;shelf life&quot; of a piece of inventory;
    /// when negative may impact the items quality.
    int SellIn { get; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>One small, but significant, detail of this model (as compared to its predecessor), is the loss of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/units-of-measure" target="_blank">units of measure</a>. We simply
use an <code>int</code> to describe an inventory item's &ldquo;shelf life&rdquo;. Contrast that with the F# model, where <code>SellIn</code> is of type <code>int&lt;days&gt;</code>. This is, perhaps, trivial in terms of functionality. But the loss of context definitely makes things less &ldquo;self documenting&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="logic">Logic</h4>
<p>Finally, having defined: two structs; five records; and two interfaces, we can
manipulate instances of these types in the core of the model. Specifically, the
static class <code>Inventory</code> defines <code>UpdateItem</code>, which will perform the same role
as the <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/4_extended/source/GildedRose.Inventory/Inventory.fs#L41" target="_blank"><code>updateItem</code> function in the F# model</a>, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">/// Change the quality and &quot;shelf life&quot; for an Item  (i.e. apply
/// appropriate rules for the passage of a single &quot;business day&quot;).
public static IInventoryItem UpdateItem(IInventoryItem stock) =&gt;
    stock switch
    {
        null =&gt; throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(stock)),

        IOrdinary ordinary =&gt; UpdateOrdinary(ordinary),

        // if it's not ordinary, it must be legendary
        _ =&gt; stock // Legendary things never change!
    };
</code></pre>
<p>This static method takes a single <code>IInventoryItem</code> instance as input. It then
uses a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/switch-expression" target="_blank">switch expression</a> to take one of three different actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>stock</code> is <code>null</code>, an exception is thrown (line 6).</li>
<li>If the stock implements <code>IOrdinary</code>, control is forwarded to another method (line 8).</li>
<li>If neither of the above are true, which <em>should</em> be <code>Legendary</code>, the input is returned &ldquo;as is&rdquo; (line 11).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note, the logic listed above is dependent on the actual
inventory item types being correctly annotated (or not!) with the <code>IOrdinary</code>
interface. Regardless, the first and third cases are obvious enough. But let's
look into the second branch in more detail. The <code>UpdateOrdinary</code> method begins
as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">private static IOrdinary UpdateOrdinary(IOrdinary ordinary)
{
    var agedTo = ordinary.SellIn - 1; // days
    var rateOfChange = agedTo &lt; 0 ? 2 : 1;
</code></pre>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it takes an instance of <code>IOrdinary</code> as input. It then calculates
two new values. <code>agedTo</code> is computed by decreasing the &ldquo;shelf life&rdquo; of the given
input by one business day. This new &ldquo;age&rdquo; is then used to determine the
<code>rateOfChange</code>, which is a multiplier effecting how quickly an item's <code>Quality</code>
will decrease or increase. The code then proceeds into another switch expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">    return ordinary switch
    {
        Depreciating { Quality: var quality } item =&gt; item with
        {
            SellIn = agedTo,
            Quality = quality - new Quality(rateOfChange)
        },
        Appreciating { Quality: var quality } item =&gt; item with
        {
            SellIn = agedTo,
            Quality = quality + new Quality(rateOfChange)
        },
        Conjured { Quality: var quality } item =&gt; item with
        {
            SellIn = agedTo,
            Quality = quality - new Quality(2 * rateOfChange)
        },
</code></pre>
<p>Here, different actions are taken based on the type of inventory item. However,
they all follow the same pattern. First, the current <code>Quality</code> is extracted.
Then, a new instance of the stock item is created (using a record's
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record#nondestructive-mutation" target="_blank">nondestructive mutation syntax</a>). Each new record has its &ldquo;shelf life&rdquo;
changed to the value computed at the start of this method. Meanwhile, each new
record's worth is changed accordingly:</p>
<ul>
<li>On line 6, <code>Depreciating</code> items have their worth <em>decreased</em></li>
<li>For <code>Appreciating</code> items, on line 11, worth is <em>increased</em></li>
<li><code>Conjured</code> items' worth decreases <em>twice as fast</em> as <code>Depreciating</code> items (line 16)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we move onto the inventory with the most complex rules: <code>BackstagePass</code>es.
In order to address said complexity, there are actually four different branches
in our switch expression. First, we consider the case where &ldquo;shelf life&rdquo;, after
being updated, has fallen below zero.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">        BackstagePass item when agedTo &lt; 0 =&gt; item with
        {
            SellIn = agedTo,
            Quality = Quality.MinValue
        },
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, on line 4, we fix the item's worth to the lowest possible value
(<code>Quality.MinValue</code>). Note also, we could optimize this code such that the
item's quality is only updated if it was previously non-negative. However, such
an enhancement has been left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>We now move on to cases where, after being aged, the current backstage pass has not yet
past expiry. All three cases are similar, increasing quality by a different
amount  based on the number of days until expiry.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">        //  NOTE
        //  ----
        //  Pass quality has a &quot;hard cliff&quot;, based on &quot;shelf life&quot;.
        //  However, until then, its value is calculated against
        //  the _current_ expiry (i.e. before advancing the clock).
        BackstagePass { Quality: var quality, SellIn: &lt;= 5 } item =&gt; item with
        {
            SellIn = agedTo,
            Quality = quality + new Quality(3)
        },
        BackstagePass { Quality: var quality, SellIn: &lt;= 10 } item =&gt; item with
        {
            SellIn = agedTo,
            Quality = quality + new Quality(2)
        },
        BackstagePass { Quality: var quality } item =&gt; item with
        {
            SellIn = agedTo,
            Quality = quality + new Quality(1)
        },
</code></pre>
<p>As indicated in the previous snippet, when determining days-until-expiry, we
need to look at the &ldquo;shelf life&rdquo; of the backstage pass <em>before</em> it was aged.
This subtle detail is essential for preserving the same behavior as the legacy
code being replaced. Beyond that, we can see the simple relationship between
&ldquo;days left&rdquo; and quality increase, as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: right;">Days until expiry</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">Amount of increase</th>
<th>Relevant lines of code</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">0 ...  5</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">3</td>
<td>lines  6 through  10, inclusive</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">6 ... 10</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">2</td>
<td>lines 11 through 15, inclusive</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">11 ...  âˆž</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">1</td>
<td>lines 16 through 20, inclusive</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Finally, the method concludes with a &ldquo;catch all&rdquo; pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">        _ =&gt; throw new InvalidProgramException($&quot;Inventory unknown: {ordinary}&quot;)
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>We don't expect to ever fall into this last branch of the code. However, it is
needed to make the compiler happy. Further, if this exception were ever to be
raised, it would indicate a serious problem, most likely in the definition of
<code>IInventoryItem</code> instances. It is curious to note: this is one of the drawbacks
of an &ldquo;open hierarchy&rdquo;. In other words, the &ldquo;closed hierarchy&rdquo; of the F# model
ensures &ldquo;exhaustive handling&rdquo; <em>without</em> requiring a wildcard case. Regardless,
the <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/6_model-cs/source/GildedRose/Inventory.cs" target="_blank">full implementation of <code>UpdateItem</code></a> may be found online.</p>
<h3 id="tidying-up">Tidying Up</h3>
<p>At long last we come back to where it all began, the <code>Main</code> method of the
<code>Program</code> class. As compared to the <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/4_extended/source/GildedRose/Program.cs#L12" target="_blank">previous version</a>, we will make the
following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store the inventory as a local variable rather than a field</li>
<li>Construct items of the appropriate types, as defined in <code>InventoryItem.cs</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These two changes let us delete all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>GildedRose.Item</code> class</li>
<li>The <code>IList&lt;Item?&gt; Items</code> field</li>
<li>The static method <code>UpdateItems</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This last point is especially significant, as the now-removed method was primarily used to
simplify conversion between <code>Inventory.Item</code> and <code>GildedRose.Item</code>. Consolidating
types has lead to a very satisfying reduction in overall code. And less code
means less chances for a bug to sneak into the program. Finally, the newly
re-worked <code>Main</code> method is shown here, in its entirety:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public static void Main()
{
    WriteLine(&quot;OMGHAI!&quot;);

    var items = new List&lt;IInventoryItem&gt;
    {
        new Depreciating  (Dex5Vest, new Quality(20), SellIn: 10),
        new Appreciating  (AgedBrie, new Quality( 0), SellIn:  2),
        new Depreciating  (Mongoose, new Quality( 7), SellIn:  5),
        new Legendary     (Sulfuras),
        new BackstagePass (StageTix, new Quality(20), SellIn: 15),
        new Conjured      (ManaCake, new Quality( 6), SellIn:  3)
    };

    foreach (var item in items)
    {
        var (quality, sellIn) =
            // Update program state
            UpdateItem(item) switch
            {
                IOrdinary
                {
                    Quality: var value,
                    SellIn: var days
                } =&gt; ((int)value, days),

                // if it's not ordinary, it must be legendary
                _ =&gt; ((int)new MagicQuality(), 0)

            };

        // Display updated inventory
        WriteLine($&quot;Item {{ Name = {item.Name}&quot; +
                  $&quot;, Quality = {quality}&quot; +
                  $&quot;, SellIn = {sellIn} }}&quot;);
    }

    WriteLine(&quot;Press &lt;RETURN&gt; to exit.&quot;);
    ReadLine();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then program begins by printing a greeting to standard output (line 3). Next,
(lines 5 through 13, inclusive) we initialize the <em>current</em> inventory.
The interesting &ldquo;meat&rdquo; of the program occurs on lines 15 through 36, inclusive.
Having initialized the inventory, we now iterate through everything using a
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/discriminated-unions" target="_blank"><code>foreach</code> loop</a>. Each item, in its turn:</>
<ul>
<li>is updated via a call to <code>Inventory.UpdateItem</code> (line 19)</li>
<li>is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/patterns#property-pattern" target="_blank">decomposed</a> into its constituent values (lines 21 though 25, and line 28)</li>
<li>said constituent values are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples" target="_blank">bound to local variables</a> (line 17)</li>
<li>said local variables are printed to standard output (lines 33 through 35)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, the format used in printing exactly matches that of the legacy program.
This is necessary, as it obviates the need to make any changes to the
<a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/6_model-cs/source/GildedRose.Test/ProgramTests.cs#L14" target="_blank">approval test</a> in the test suite. Finally, we prompt the user to signal when
they are done reading what we've printed (lines 38 and 39). If everything has
gone as planned, there is no observable difference in the program's behavior.
Further, 100% of the test suite should still be &ldquo;passing&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Through these changes we've preserved <em>nearly</em> all the benefits of previous
efforts, while managing to keep the actual source code fairly &ldquo;lean&rdquo;. Further,
we reduced the breadth of knowledge required to support this code base. It's
fair to say that, overall, we <em>decreased the maintenance burden</em> for the Gilded
Rose Inn's inventory management software.</p>
<p>From this foundation, there are several possible future enhancements.
A motivated developer might experiment with any (or all) of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the program to update multiple &ldquo;days&rdquo; in one run</li>
<li>Load/save inventory from/into persistent storage</li>
<li>Change the output to display the amount of change for each item</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, all of the code in this blog post, plus the test suite, can be
found in the <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose" target="_blank">companion repository</a>, in a branch called <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/tree/6_model-cs" target="_blank"><code>6_model-cs</code></a>.
And, if you have questions or want to share feedback, there's also a
<a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/discussions" target="_blank">discussion forum</a> for this blog series at the companion repo.
Have fun, and happy coding!</p>

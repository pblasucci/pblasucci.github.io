demonstrate incrementally improving a legacy code base which has thorny
requirements, while also presenting a few different software development tools
or concepts. The full series is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>We've technically concluded our series on the <a href="https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose" target="_blank">Gilded Rose Kata</a>. You can
see the final state-of-affairs in the <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose" target="_blank">companion repository</a>, under a branch
called <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/tree/4_extended" target="_blank"><code>4_extended</code></a> (and if you haven't yet read the previous entries in the
series, now is a good time to get caught up). However, it turns out a bit more
fun can yet be eked out of this activity. Up until now, we've been operating
under some fairly specific constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the legacy program</li>
<li>Don't mess with the <code>GildedRose.Item</code> class or the <code>Program.Items</code> field</li>
</ul>
<p>But let's play a bit of <em>What If...</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Management at the Gilded Rose Inn has been really impressed with all the
changes. And just this week, the Goblin in the Corner, announced he's retiring
(after 107! years of loyal service) to his condominium in Boca Raton, where he
hopes to play shuffleboard and work on model ship building. So, you've been
given the go ahead to take full ownership of the inventory program, going
&ldquo;all in&rdquo; on F#.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plan then, is to create a new F# console application and to directly
incorporate the source of the <code>GildedRose.Inventory</code> project. The test suite
will remain as-is, providing (as always) a safety-net for all changes being made.</p>
<h3 id="the-swap">The Swap</h3>
<p>The easiest place to start is to simply delete the <code>GildedRose</code> console
application project from the overall solution. Then, using the means of your
choosing (CLI, IDE, et cetera), create a new project -- an
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/get-started-vscode" target="_blank">F# console application</a> -- called (unsurprisingly) <code>GildedRose</code>. Theres
should ultimately be three files in this new project (in this order):</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Inventory.fsi</code></li>
<li><code>Inventory.fs</code></li>
<li><code>Program.fs</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The first two files are taken directly from the project <code>GildedRose.Inventory</code>.
Once the files are copied, the F# library project can also be deleted. But wait!
Didn't that project also have a file called <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/4_extended/source/GildedRose.Inventory/Compat.fs" target="_blank"><code>Compat.fs</code></a>? Don't we need that?
Actually, we don't. It only helped to smooth out calling F# from C#. No more
C# means no more need for compatibility. Further, we can simplify the inventory
files slightly. We can remove the following metadata from each file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">[&lt;CompiledName(&quot;UpdateItem&quot;))&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>It appeared in <code>Inventory.fsi</code> and <code>Inventory.fs</code>, on lines <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/4_extended/source/GildedRose.Inventory/Inventory.fsi#L63" target="_blank">63</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/4_extended/source/GildedRose.Inventory/Inventory.fs#L40" target="_blank">40</a>,
respectively. Much like the compatibility file, a lack of C# obviates the need
for the attribute.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the main file, <code>Program.fs</code>, which we'll flesh out now. It
starts, as is common in .NET, with a namespace declaration and a statement to
import some needed libraries:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">namespace GildedRose

open GildedRose.Inventory
</code></pre>
<p>The file further defines a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/modules" target="_blank">module</a> containing the names of several
&ldquo;well known&rdquo; inventory items. This will be used later to initialize program
state. It is analogous to the file <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/4_extended/source/GildedRose/KnownItems.cs" target="_blank"><code>KnownItems.cs</code></a> in the now-discarded C#
project.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">/// Since an item's &quot;kind&quot; (and thus, its behavior) might sometimes be
/// determined by its name, it's useful to have some well-known names.
[&lt;RequireQualifiedAccess&gt;]
module KnownItems =
  // Depreciating items
  let [&lt;Literal&gt;] Dex5Vest = &quot;+5 Dexterity Vest&quot;
  let [&lt;Literal&gt;] Mongoose = &quot;Elixir of the Mongoose&quot;

  // Conjured items
  let [&lt;Literal&gt;] ManaCake = &quot;Conjured Mana Cake&quot;

  // Appreciating items
  let [&lt;Literal&gt;] AgedBrie = &quot;Aged Brie&quot;

  // Backstage Passes
  let [&lt;Literal&gt;] StageTix = &quot;Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert&quot;

  // Legendary items
  let [&lt;Literal&gt;] Sulfuras = &quot;Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we arrive at the <code>Program</code> module, which houses a single function
comprising the entirety of the non-model-related program logic (i.e. state
management), show here in its entirety:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">module Program =
  [&lt;EntryPoint&gt;]
  let main _ =
    printfn &quot;OMGHAI!&quot;

    let items =
      [
        Depreciating  (KnownItems.Dex5Vest, Quality.Of 20uy, 10&lt;days&gt;)
        Appreciating  (KnownItems.AgedBrie, Quality.Of  0uy,  2&lt;days&gt;)
        Depreciating  (KnownItems.Mongoose, Quality.Of  7uy,  5&lt;days&gt;)
        Legendary     (KnownItems.Sulfuras, MagicQuality())
        BackstagePass (KnownItems.StageTix, Quality.Of 20uy, 15&lt;days&gt;)
        Conjured      (KnownItems.ManaCake, Quality.Of  6uy,  3&lt;days&gt;)
      ]

    for item in items do
      let name, quality, sellIn =
        match updateItem item with
        | Legendary (name, quality) -&gt;
            // normalize for compatibility with existing approval test
            (name, byte quality, 0)

        // ⮝⮝⮝ legendary / ordinary ⮟⮟⮟

        | BackstagePass (name, quality, sellIn)
        | Appreciating  (name, quality, sellIn)
        | Depreciating  (name, quality, sellIn)
        | Conjured      (name, quality, sellIn) -&gt;
            // normalize for compatibility with existing approval test
            (name, byte quality, int sellIn)

      printfn $&quot;Item {{ Name = {name}, Quality = {quality}, SellIn = {sellIn} }}&quot;

    printfn &quot;Press &lt;RETURN&gt; to exit.&quot;
    System.Console.ReadLine() |&gt; ignore
    0 // OK!
</code></pre>
<p>Lines 2 and 3 define the program's entry point. The function <code>main</code> actually
has the type <code>string array -&gt; int</code> (read as: &quot;receives a string array as input,
and produces an integer as output&quot;), which is required for any function marked
with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/functions/entry-point" target="_blank"><code>EntryPointAttribute</code></a>. However, as we don't use the input
arguments (the <code>string array</code>), it has been <em>discarded</em>, as indicated by the
use of an underscore (<code>_</code>) on line 3. Should we have wished to access this data,
which the program receives at startup, we need to simply replace the underscore
with a valid identified (e.g. <code>args</code>).</p>
<p>Then program begins by printing a greeting to standard output (line 4). Next,
(lines 6 through 14, inclusive) we initialize the <em>current</em> inventory. The interesting &ldquo;meat&rdquo; of the program occurs on lines 16 through 32, inclusive.
Having initialized the inventory, we now iterate through everything using a
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/loops-for-in-expression" target="_blank"><code>for...in</code> loop</a>. Each item, in its turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>is updated via a call to <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/5_fs-alone/source/GildedRose/Inventory.fs#L40" target="_blank"><code>Inventory.updateItem</code></a> (line 18)</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/pattern-matching" target="_blank">matched for its item kind</a> (lines 19, 25, 26, 27, 28)</li>
<li>decomposed into its constituent values (lines 21 and 30)</li>
<li>said constituent values are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/functions/let-bindings" target="_blank">bound to local names</a> (line 17)</li>
<li>said local names are printed to standard output (line 32)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, the format used in printing exactly matches that of the legacy program.
This is necessary, as it obviates the need to make any changes to the
<a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/blob/5_fs-alone/source/GildedRose.Test/ProgramTests.fs#L17" target="_blank">approval test</a> in the test suite. Finally, we prompt the user to signal when
they are done reading what we've printed (lines 34 and 35). Then, on line 36, we exit (indicating a
successful run of the program). If everything has gone as planned, there is no
observable difference in the program's behavior. Further, 100% of the test
suite should still be &ldquo;passing&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Through these changes it's worth noting what's missing. There are now only two
projects, instead of three. The number of non-test-related files has been
reduced from four down to three. And, most importantly, we're using the model
for everything (except state management). That is, we've eliminated the <code>Item</code>
class (once so protected by the goblin in the corner), as it serves no purpose.
Further, we reduced the breadth of knowledge required to support this code base.
It's fair to say that, overall, we <em>decreased the maintenance burden</em> for the
Gilded Rose Inn's inventory management software.</p>
<p>From this foundation, there are several possible future enhancements.
A motivated developer might experiment with any (or all) of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the program to update multiple &ldquo;days&rdquo; in one run</li>
<li>Load/save inventory from/into persistent storage</li>
<li>Change the output to display the amount of change for each item</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, all of the code in this blog post, plus the test suite, can be
found in the <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose" target="_blank">companion repository</a>, in a branch called <a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/tree/5_fs-alone" target="_blank"><code>5_fs-alone</code></a>.
And, if you have questions or want to share feedback, there's also a
<a href="https://github.com/pblasucci/GrowningGildedRose/discussions" target="_blank">discussion forum</a> for this blog series at the companion repo.
Have fun, and happy coding!</p>

<p>A few folks on the internet have inquired about my new, fully bespoke weblog
engine -- although &ldquo;blogging system&rdquo; might be a more accurate description. So,
for those curious (and so future me can regain lost context), what follows is a
tour of &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Godfrey_Saxe#Legacy" title="John Godfrey Saxe">How the sausage gets made</a>&rdquo; (to paraphrase Mr. John Godfrey Saxe).</p>
<aside>
<h4>TL; DR</h4>
<p>It's all just HTML, CSS, and PowerShell.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Why a new blog? Why now?</p>
<p>Why not?!</p>
<p>I don't blog very often -- but I hope to improve the status quo. How? By using tooling
which is more conducive to how I like to work. So, I did a bunch of soul-searching and
developed the following list of requirements (in descending order of priority):</p>
<ol>
<li>Fully own my content</li>
<li>Full control over semantics, layout, and styling</li>
<li>Embrace HTML as a writers medium</li>
<li>No comments</li>
<li>No trackers</li>
<li>Minimal Markdown</li>
<li>No YAML -- HTML is perfectly capable of storing metadata</li>
<li>No Node.js (or anything from that ecosystem)</li>
<li>Minimal JavaScript</li>
<li>Embrace <a href="https://git-scm.com/" title="Fast version control">Git</a> as versioning, auditing, workflow tool</li>
<li>No backend</li>
<li>Import old content</li>
<li>Single repository</li>
<li>Free hosting</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of these, especially the first three requirements, pointed <em>very</em>
strongly toward a self-managed solution (as opposed to: WordPress, Medium, et
cetera). Further, after doing a bunch of research into popular tooling, the
latter half of my requirements meant I needed to code up something &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, in the end, I developed a workflow which uses <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#-powershell" title="pwsh Everywhere!">PowerShell Core</a>, and some
very basic <em>Git-fu</em>, to stitch together a mix of HTML and CSS (and, yes, I
<em>did</em> sneak in a bit of Markdown and JavaScript... but in a minimal and <em>focused</em>
manner).</p>
<p>Before I wax poetic on the merits of PowerShell, let me spell out my workflow.
This will, hopefully, help shine a light on the benefits of the system I've
put in place.</p>
<h3 id="my-workflow">My Workflow</h3>
<p>I find that blogging, much like the essays I used to write in school, works
better if I follow a process. Specifically, each post goes through the
following stages:</p>
<p><img src="../media/post-lifecycle.png" alt="Lifecycle of a blog post " title="Draft -&gt; Ready -&gt; Final -&gt; Serve" /></p>
<p>It's worth noting that I can perform versioning (via git) at any and every
stage of the post's lifecycle. This means I can pause work for hours/days/weeks
and still pick up right where I left off. Additionally, I only automate the bare
minimum, allowing plenty of human oversight and intervention -- and any
transition is manually initiated. This, combined with the stand-alone nature of
the individual posts (relative to the templating system), means I retain full
stylistic control, while trivially permitting &ldquo;one off&rdquo; tweaks. What's more: I
can have a single post exist in multiple stages at the same time. I do this
very very rarely. But it has been useful for fine-tuning the overall process.</p>
<h4 id="stage-1-draft">Stage 1: Draft</h4>
<pre><code class="language-shell">weblog&gt; new-item ./draft/blog-recipe.md &amp;&amp; start-process code './draft/blog-recipe.md'
</code></pre>
<p>This is the stage of raw ideas, where posts tend to linger the longest. It's
just a folder full of <a href="https://commonmark.org/" title="CommonMark: A strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown">Markdown</a> files. Some are barely outlines. Some are
novellas. Maybe I drop in an image or some ASCII art. But the goal in this phase is simply letting the concepts flow out of
my brain and into the file.</p>
<h4 id="stage-2-ready">Stage 2: Ready</h4>
<pre><code class="language-shell">weblog&gt; ./move-content.ps1 -Stage Render -Include blog-recipe.md &amp;&amp; code ./ready/blog-recipe.html
weblog> dotnet serve -d ./ready/ -o
</code></pre>
<p>This is where posts go when I'm satisfied with the raw content. It's also where
I do the most mundane drudgery. At this point, I transition from Markdown files
to proper HTML. Then I get to work: adjusting the layout of the content;
tweaking the associated CSS; revising images and other media; and enriching
the post with metadata (topical tags, mostly). It's also during this phase that
I bring in a hosting tool (usually <a href="https://github.com/natemcmaster/dotnet-serve" title="natemcmaster/dotnet-serve"><code>dotnet serve</code></a> or
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" title="The smartest JavaScript IDE">JetBrains WebStorm</a>), which allows me to preview everything exactly how the
finished product will appear. Finally, I'll give the post a full round of
editorial scrunity (i.e. grammar, spelling, <em>and</em> literary style). Only then is
it ready for publication.</p>
<h4 id="stage-3-final">Stage 3: Final</h4>
<pre><code class="language-shell">weblog&gt; ./move-content.ps1 -Stage Publish -Include blog-recipe.html
weblog&gt; dotnet serve -d ./docs/ -o
</code></pre>
<p>This is, arguably, the most automation-heavy phase of the lifecycle. Once a
post arrives here, it receives another thorough review of everything (again,
via a high-fidelity live preview). However, as part of being moved into this
stage, the metadata from the previous step has been extended with a timestamp
and -- most importantly -- used to generate one, or more, listing pages. In
other words, the weblog's &ldquo;home page&rdquo; (listing all posts in reverse
chronological order) gets updated. But also, similar listing pages are
generated corresponding to the tags collected from across all the published
<em>and</em> deployed blog posts. All that's left now is to &ldquo;go live&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="stage-4-serve">Stage 4: Serve</h4>
<pre><code class="language-shell">weblog&gt; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m &quot;publish blog recipe&quot; &amp;&amp; git push
weblog&gt; start-process https://paul.blasuc.ci
</code></pre>
<p>'Serving' is the last, and simplest, phase. I commit the published posts, and
generated listings, to Git. And I push the commit to GitHub.com, which handles
the hosting of the static HTML/CSS/JS/et cetera files automatically, via
<a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="Websites for you and your projects.">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cmon-really-powershell">C'mon, really?! PowerShell?!</h3>
<p>I know a lot of folks like to dump on PowerShell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It's got a weird syntax. Just use Perl.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The world doesn't need yet another shell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Learn a real shell like bash or zsh.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ewwww... Micro&dollar;oft!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so on, ad nauseam.</p>
<p>So, while I don't think it's the best tool for <em>everything</em>, I do think it's
a great fit for this project. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's simple... a single script handles everything (and really, it's just 3 functions).</li>
<li>It's robust... everything I need is &ldquo;in-the-box&rdquo; (no messing about with dependencies).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's unpack this second point. What do I actually <em>need</em> to make things &ldquo;go&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Well, first, I need a simple parameterized command-line interface. PowerShell
has extensive, first-class support for all manner of CLI arguments... Flags?
Lists? Defaults? You name it, it's supported. And with built-in validation to
boot!</p>
<p>But I also need pathing and file management (move, copy, drop, read, et cetera).
Yup! That's covered, too. But even more so, I need <em>template</em> file management.
And this is where PowerShell really shines. Just one little function means that
<em>any text file can be used as a template with full data substitution</em> (credit
to <a href="https://www.pimbrouwers.com/" title="Pim is AWESOME!!!">Pim Brouwers</a> for clueing me into this one...thanks!). Yes, that's right.
It does HTML templates. It does JSON templates. Hell! I have a failed project
which used this technique with F# templates. And it's <em>tiny</em>.
It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">#
# Utility which helps bind key-value data into textual content
function Invoke-Template {
    param([ScriptBlock] $scriptBlock)

    function Render-Template {
        param([string] $template)

        Invoke-Expression &quot;@`&quot;`r`n$template`r`n`&quot;@&quot;
    }

    &amp; $scriptBlock
}
</code></pre>
<p>Oh! But also, I need to convert Markdown to HTML. PowerShell ships with support
for CommonMark as a one-liner (where <code>$fullPath</code> is just the location of a
<code>*.md</code> file on disk):</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">$markdown = Get-Content $fullPath -Raw | ConvertFrom-Markdown
</code></pre>
<p>Hmm... this is cool. But I also need to work with collections of data (in order
to build the listing pages). No worries. Powershell works with <em>objects</em> where
most other shells work with file descriptors or text. So, naturally, I have
arrays and hashmaps at the ready.</p>
<p>Finally, rounding it out are all the little things one expects from a shell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular expressions... to extract values from text files.</li>
<li>Conditionals... with which to make decisions.</li>
<li>Full access to the underlying OS... for launching processes and such.</li>
</ul>

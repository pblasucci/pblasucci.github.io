<p>What?! Are we <em>stiiill</em> talking about single-case discriminated unions in F#?</p>
<p>Well... um, yeah. We are. Sorry.</p>
<p>Despite having written <a href="https://paul.blasuc.ci/posts/really-scu.html">quite a few words</a> about the topic recently, I
realized there was a little bit more I'd like to say about it. Specifically,
I want to clarify a point made, briefly, in the previous article. I've received
several questions about it (all from folks who're generally much cleverer than
me), so follow-up seems worthwhile.</p>
<p>Also, I realized the previous post talked a lot about <em>not</em> using SCUs --
instead suggesting that records, structs, or tagged types might better serve
certain ends. However, I realized there's one scenario where I will very often
<em>prefer single-case unions</em>. And I felt I owed it to the discussion to review
said usage in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="a-clarification">A Clarification</h3>
<p>In my <a href="https://paul.blasuc.ci/posts/really-scu.html#openwindow">last exposition</a>, I included an aside titled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why lock the door if you're gonna leave the window wide open?!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In it, I argued <em>against</em> accessing the underlying data for a wrapped type, either by adding a member called <code>.Value</code>, or by providing a <code>let value ...</code> function in a supporting module. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Price = private Price' of decimal

[&lt;RequireQualifiedAccess&gt;]
module Price =
    let value (Price' value) = value
    // ⮝⮝⮝ let's have less of this, please.

    (* ... other behaviors elided ... *)

(* ... elsewhere ... *)

let computeLineValue quantity price =
    // let's assume, for argument's sake, this function works in different
    // context where we shift from Domain model to primitive values...
    // since otherwise we'd hide this sort of thing inside our domain types.
    Quantity.value quantity * (price |&gt; Price.value |&gt; float)
</code></pre>
<p>Please allow me to explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is only in the context of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/EvansClassification.html">DDD Value Objects</a>.</li>
<li>The Value Object <em>IS</em> the &ldquo;primitive&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, you should not think of it as &ldquo;exposing the underlying value&rdquo;.
Rather, you want to think in terms of &ldquo;converting a (domain) primitive to a
different context's primitive&rdquo;. This will help with information hiding, and
helps guide consumers in the expected ways of using the value object. The
canonical example of this (for me) is the <code>System.Guid</code> type found in the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.guid?view=net-5.0">.NET standard library</a>. Internally, <code>Guid</code> stores data via
<a href="https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/Guid.cs,b622ef5f6b76c10a">several numeric fields</a>. Yet, it doesn't expose any of them -- because
&ldquo;the guid&rdquo; <em>is</em> &ldquo;the primitive&rdquo;. Instead, it has methods like <code>.ToString()</code> and
<code>.ToByteArray()</code>, which provide conversion into different &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; types.
The same might be argued for email address, currency, or any number of other
value objects. Thus, the previous example <em>might</em> be better coded as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Price = private Price' of decimal

  static member op_Explicit (Price' value) = float value
  // ⮝⮝⮝ this will encourage more direct logic at call sites.

(* ... elsewhere ... *)

let computeLineValue quantity price =
  // let's assume, for argument's sake, this function works in different
  // context where we shift from Domain model to primitive values...
  // since otherwise we'd hide this sort of thing inside our domain types.
  float quantity * float price
</code></pre>
<h3 id="and-a-confession">And a Confession</h3>
<p>After digesting my <a href="https://paul.blasuc.ci/posts/really-scu.html#conclusion">previous post</a>, you might think I don't use SCUs all
that often, and that I'm not a fan of them. But that's not exactly true. There
is one scenario where I use them quite a bit. That scenario? Type-directed
random data generation with <a href="https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/TestData.html">FsCheck</a>.</p>
<p>Very often, I will want to customize how random data is generated for my tests.
FsCheck tends to prefer driving things off of the nominal type of a given test
input. So, it's not uncommon for me to use a single-case union as a thin wrapper
for some bespoke generation logic. &ldquo;What sort of bespoke generation logic?&rdquo;, you
ask. All sorts. But mainly, whenever I need to limit or direct the values being
generated (but still random-ish-ly?). The key points for consideration are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A need for a real nominal type (an alias or a tag won't cut it).</li>
<li>The type's scope is limited to my test suite.</li>
<li>The wrapper type only serves to help FsCheck's internal machinery.</li>
<li>The wrapper is (almost always) <em>immediately discarded</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example hopefully makes things clear.</p>
<p>Imagine a parsing function which only succeeds on a certain, limited set of
characters. We'd like to test this against a range of passing inputs -- but
hand-crafting strings is tedious, and any old random string won't do. However,
if we create a thin wrapper type, we can get FsCheck to produce meaningful values for us.
In practice, a test of our hypothetical parser might appear as follows:</p>
<aside>
<h4 id="aside">About the test</h4>
<p>Let's assume this is a sort of 'oracular' test. That is, maybe our parser is
<em>much</em> faster than a regular expression -- but we know the regular expression
to be correct. So we use <em>it</em> to validate the accuracy of our parser.</p>
<p>For more details on <em>test oracles</em>, you might like what
<a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing-2/#test-oracle">Scott Wlaschin</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_oracle">Wikipedia</a> have to say about them.</p>
</aside>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let `Can parse valid input` (UrlSafeString input) =
  let expected = Some input
  let actually = SuperFastParser.TryParse input

  expected = actually
  |@ $&quot;%A{expected} &lt;&gt; %A{actually}&quot;
  |&gt; Prop.collect (input)
</code></pre>
<p>In the previous code, notice how we don't really interact with the singe-case
union. It's a directive for FsCheck. We <em>immediately discard it</em> in favor of
its randomly-generated inner value. Testing then proceeds as normal (and gives
us some helpful diagnostics, too). So how did get the correct inputs? Turns out,
we can use the SCU and a Regex to produce strings which, although random, conform to our needs.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">/// Models a string consisting of only letters, numbers, underscores, and/or hyphens.
type UrlSafeString = UrlSafeString of string

type Generators =
  static member UrlSafeString =
    // Need to validate both during generation _and_ shrinking; so helper function.
    let isValid value =
      try
        Regex.IsMatch(
          input=value,
          pattern=&quot;&quot;&quot;\A[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*\z&quot;&quot;&quot;,
          options=RegexOptions.Compiled,
          matchTimeout=TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1.0)
        )
      with _ -&gt; false

    let generate =
      Arb.generate&lt;_&gt;
      |&gt; Gen.where (fun (NonEmptyString value) -&gt; isValid value)
      |&gt; Gen.map   (fun (NonEmptyString value) -&gt; UrlSafeString value)
      // ⮝⮝⮝ FsCheck doesn't have a combinator for Gen&lt;'T&gt; which
      // performs a filter and a map in a single pass. Thus, pipeline.

    let shrink (UrlSafeString value) =
      value
      |&gt; NonEmptyString
      |&gt; Arb.shrink
      |&gt; Seq.choose (fun (NonEmptyString value) -&gt;
        if isValid value then Some (UrlSafeString value) else None
      )

    Arb.fromGenShrink (generate, shrink)
</code></pre>
<p>I don't want to go into too much detail about writing generators/shrinkers, as
that's not really the focus of this post. But briefly, the core logic in
<code>generate</code> is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a random non-empty string of characters.</li>
<li>Only permit generated strings which match our regular expression.</li>
<li>Wrap valid values in our single-case union.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, the logic in <code>shrink</code> is similar, albeit with sequences of values.</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert from our nominal wrapper to a primitive type known to FsCheck.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Cheat&rdquo;, by using the shrinker built into FsCheck.</li>
<li>Discard any shrunken values which do not match our regular expression.</li>
<li>Wrap valid values in our single-case union.</li>
</ol>
<p>We do have a bit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country-western_two-step">Texas two-step</a> (the dance -- not the lottery) with
wrapping and unwrapping as part of the <code>generate</code> and <code>shrink</code> logic. But
overall, this approach works well for many purposes. It's also important to stress: this technique
of using a single-case union wrapper to direct FsCheck's data generation is <em>not</em>
limited to strings. Other common applications include: generating numbers such
that the value is within a fixed range; generating just one case out of a
typical multiple-case discriminated union; and much more! Some cursory searching
of &ldquo;property-based testing&rdquo; will, no doubt, provide lots of motivational examples.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ultimately, single-case unions are not unlike any other F# language feature.
They have their time and place to shine. But apply them judiciously, and be
sure to avail yourself of the full range of capabilities the language offers.
Above all, <em>understand the trade-offs inherent to the choices your are making</em>.
Now -- finally! -- I hope to &ldquo;shelve&ldquo; the discussion of single-case unions,
and talk about other interesting topics (for at least a few months... Promise! &#x1F609;).</p>
<p>Good luck! And happy coding!</p>

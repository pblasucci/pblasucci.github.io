<p><em>(TL;DR -- I don't often use single-case discriminated unions. Jump down to
the <a href="#picktype" title="Go to: Flowchart">flowchart</a> to see what I commonly use instead.)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In F#, single-case discriminated unions crop up fairly often. However, in many
cases, there are other alternatives one might consider. In this post I want to
sketch some of these alternatives, providing an account of the possibilities
and -- more importantly -- the trade-offs involved. In order to keep this post
to a reasonable length, I will consider three very common scenarios for which
one might use single-case discriminated unions. Specifically, they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>As <a href="#markervalue" title="Go to: Marker Values">Marker Values</a></li>
<li>As <a href="#taggedprimitive" title="Go to: Tagged Primitives">Tagged Primitives</a></li>
<li>As <a href="#valueobject" title="Go to: Value Objects">Value Objects</a></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="disclaimer"><em>!!! DISCLAIMER</em> !!!</h4>
<p>The advice in this post is meant to be a set of <em>guidelines</em>. A starting
point. A way of consciously evaluating decisions (instead of just blindly
copy-pasting some code). Further, after nearly 15 years of doing F#
professionally, I've developed a lot of 'instinctual decision making'. This
blog is very much an attempt at unpacking some of that, and codifying it in a
way others might leverage. In short, it represents how <em>I</em> approach things.
This might not necessarily &ldquo;work&rdquo; for someone else. And it certainly won't
cover all possible scenarios one might encounter. Still, I hope you find it
useful.</p>
<p>Just take everything herein with a grain of salt, OK?  &#x1F609;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="marker-values">Marker Values <a id="markervalue"></a></h3>
<p>For the purposes of this discussion, let's define a &ldquo;marker value&rdquo; as: a type
only ever manifested in a single instance. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy" title="Python Standard Type Hierarchy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python's <code>None</code></a> is one example.
The <a href="https://stdlib.ponylang.io/" title="Pony Standard Library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard library in Pony</a> also uses marker values to great effect. Though
unlike Python, where <code>None</code> is a built-in construct, Pony leverages its flexible
<a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.io/types/primitives.html#what-can-you-use-a-primitive-for" title="What can you use a primitive for?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&ldquo;primitive&rdquo;</a> construct. In F#, you might see a single-case discriminated
union used for this purpose. In fact, one might argue any non-data-carrying
variant of <em>any</em> discriminated union is an example of a marker value (but I
don't want to wade too far into the weeds here).</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type AmbientAuth = AmbientAuth
</code></pre>
<p>In any case, the main things one wants out of a marker value are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It should <em>not</em> carry data</li>
<li>It should <em>not</em> support null-ness</li>
<li>It should be an actual type</li>
<li>It should have easy ergonomics (at the call site)</li>
<li><del>It should have only one instance</del> All occurrences should be semantically equivalent</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what <em>other</em> alternatives are there in F#?</p>
<p>Plot Twist!!! <strong>SCDUs <em>are</em> the perfect type for this in F#</strong> (but do consider
decorating them with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/discriminated-unions#struct-discriminated-unions" title="Struct Discriminated Unions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>StructAttribute</code></a>). Really?! Well, yes... and no.
There is one caveat. If you intend to have your F# &ldquo;marker value&rdquo; be consumed
by other .NET languages (e.g. C#, VB), you may want to consider a struct instead.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type AmbientAuth = struct (* MARKER *) end
</code></pre>
<p>Why something different for other languages? Because F# discriminated unions,
regardless of the number of variants, generate some extra code (as part of the
machinery encoding them onto the CLR). F# neatly hides this detail from you.
However, it's plainly visible in, for example, C# consumers. So, using a struct
produces a more language-neutral solution. But it will mean slightly more
cumbersome invocation for F# consumers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let auth = AmbientAuth
(* instantiation: ↑↑↑ Union vs Struct ↓↓↓ *)
let auth = AmbientAuth()

(*
!!! LOOK OUT !!!

let auth = AmbientAuth   ⮜ partially applied constructor -- NOT a value!
forgetting the parens ⮝⮝ is a subtle source of confusion
*)
</code></pre>
<p>So, to recap <em>Marker Values</em> present the following options and trade-offs:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Single-case Union</th>
<th>CLR Struct</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Pro:</em> Hits a syntactic 'sweet spot'</td>
<td><em>Pro:</em> Language neutral</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Con:</em> Funky when used outside F#</td>
<td><em>Con:</em> Instantiation cruft in F#</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="tagged-primitives">Tagged Primitives <a id="taggedprimitive"></a></h3>
<p>Perhaps the most common usage of single-case unions -- or at least the one that
leaps foremost into people's minds -- is that of a &ldquo;Tagged Primitive&rdquo;. In other
words, a simple wrapper of some other basic type, usually meant to provide more
context. Again, we can find similar constructs in other languages. Most notably,
<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Newtype" title="Haskell Newtype" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a <code>newtype</code> in Haskell</a>. Some fairly common examples of such a thing in F#
might be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type ClientId = ClientId of Guid // ⮜ this should probably be a Value Object!

type Pixels = Pixels of uint64
    // NOTE other operators omitted for brevity
    static member ( + ) (Pixels l, Pixels r) = Pixels(l + r)
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, if you squint a bit, those even (sort of) <em>look</em> like a <code>newtype</code>.
Alas, <em>F# is not Haskell</em>. Let me repeat that one more time for the folks
in the cheap seats:</p>
<p><strong><em>F# IS NOT HASKELL.</em></strong></p>
<p>It really isn't. And it certainly doesn't have <code>newtype</code>. The above examples
behave rather differently (than <code>newtype</code>) in terms of what the compiler emits.
Requests to add such a feature have, to date, languished in discussion. So,
instead, we have the previous example, or a few other alternatives. But first,
let's have some criteria for why we'd want (need?) a <code>newtype</code>-like construct.</p>
<ol>
<li>It should provide contextual information about the role of some code.</li>
<li>The 'new' type should be type-checked distinctly from the 'wrapped' type.</li>
<li>There are <em>no behavioral restrictions</em> imposed on the underlying type.</li>
</ol>
<p>This seem like very useful goals. However, item 2 means we can <em>not</em> use
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/type-abbreviations" title="F# Type Abbreviations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">type abbreviations</a>. And item 3 requires a significant amount of
'boilerplate' code to do correctly (as we want to have a lot of behavior pass
through to the underlying primitive). Also, let's pause to appreciate: if we
want the opposite of item 3, then we are almost certainly talking about a
&ldquo;Value Object&rdquo; (discussed later in this post). So what's left (besides
single-case unions)? Depending on the type being wrapped, and the target usage,
there are a few alternatives. Let's consider each in turn.</p>
<h4 id="units-of-measure">Units of Measure</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/units-of-measure" title="F# Units of Measure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Units of Measure</a> meet all our given criteria. And syntactically they are
very light-weight, as well. Further, they enforce the fundamental rules of
mathematics at compile time (e.g. quantities of dissimilar units can be
multiplied together -- but not combined via addition).</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">[&lt;Measure&gt;]
type pixels

let offset = 240UL&lt;pixels&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>However, they carry some heavy restrictions. They are <em>limited to only numeric</em>
primitives (<code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, et cetera). They are <em>erased at compile time</em> (so
no reflective meta-programming support -- and no visibility in other .NET
languages). Additionally, since many operations in .NET are <em>not</em> &ldquo;units aware&rdquo;,
it's not uncommon to have to explicitly temporarily discard the units for
certain operations (only to re-apply them later). This unwrap-compute-rewrap
dance has come to upset many an F# developer.</p>
<h4 id="generic-tags">Generic Tags</h4>
<p>It turns out, with just a little bit of hackery, we can actually get something
like Units of Measure -- but for non-numeric types. We call this a Generic Tag.
I won't go into the specific mechanics of it, though. There are a few different
ways to achieve it. And all of them are definitely <em>advanced</em> (not to mention a
bit... circumspect). However, there's a <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.UMX" title="FSharp.UMX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">library which hides the details</a>
for many (most?) common non-numeric primitives. So I <em>will</em> should you an
example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">open System

#r &quot;nuget: FSharp.UMX&quot;
open FSharp.UMX

[&lt;Measure&gt;]
type ClientId

let current : Guid&lt;ClientId&gt; = UMX.tag (Guid.NewGuid())
</code></pre>
<p>As with everything, there are some more trade-offs here. In fact, other than
lifting the restriction to numerics, generic tags have <em>all</em> the same caveats as
units of measure. Further, their are at least <em>some</em> &ldquo;units aware&rdquo; functions
(<code>abs</code>, <code>min</code>, et cetera) in the core F# library. However, those are (again) limited to numeric types.
For generic tags, you may well find yourself stripping off the tag frequently-enough that its usage becomes questionable.
It's worth exploring -- but &ldquo;individual milage may vary&rdquo;.</p>
<aside>
<h4 id="a-matter-of-philosophy">A Matter of Philosophy</h4>
<p>It's also worth noting that things like customer identifers and invoice
numbers might happen to &ldquo;be numeric&rdquo; but aren't actually &ldquo;numbers&rdquo;. That is,
subtracting one invoice number from another probably isn't a useful operation.</p>
<p>Nothing in the mechanics of Units of Measure or Generic Tags prevents such
silliness from occurring. But then again, how likely is a developer to
'accidentally' perform such an operation? Something to ponder during code
reviews, I guess.  ;-)</p>
</aside>
<h4 id="records">Records</h4>
<p>Since both Units of Measure and Generic Tags are erased at compile time, there
really is no way to expose them to other .NET Languages. And, as mentioned in
the section on Marker Values, even a Single-Case Union will surface some extra
cruft when consumed from, e.g., Visual Basic. So, in cases where a (CLR)
language-neutral implementation is required. We fallback to records, the
bread-and-butter of F# data types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type ClientId = { Value : Guid } // ⮜ this should probably be a Value Object!

type Pixels = { Value : uint64 }
    // NOTE other operators omitted for brevity
    static member ( + ) (Pixels l, Pixels r) = Pixels(l + r)
</code></pre>
<p>The drawback here is, clearly, the same as with single-case unions:
more boilerplate, as we'd like all our behavior to pass through to the
underlying primitive -- but need to code it ourselves.</p>
<aside>
<h4 id="code-generation-to-the-rescue">Code Generation to the Rescue?</h4>
<p>It's very possible much of the boilerplate for this approach could be
addressed using a technique called code generation. If that's of interest to
you, I encourage you to investigate the up-and-coming tool, <a href="https://moiraesoftware.github.io/myriad/" title="Myriad: Code Generation for F#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Myriad</a>.
It's very useful. But outside the scope of the current discussion (indeed,
one could devote several blog posts just to Myriad).</p>

<h3 id="value-objects">Value Objects <a id="valueobject"></a></h3>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned how a &ldquo;primitive with customized behavior&rdquo; is its own kind
of construct (and the closely related notion: maybe your <code>InvoiceId</code>s
<em>shouldn't</em> be divisible by <em>any</em> number?). But this is a very well-explored
area of software development. It's called a &ldquo;Value Object&rdquo;. It's an essential
part of <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/ddd/" title="Domain-driven Design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domain-Driven Design</a>. And was first defined by Eric Evans in his
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215" title="Blue Book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seminal work on the subject</a>. But let me re-iterate, here, the main aspects
of a value object:</p>
<ol>
<li>It lacks identity</li>
<li>It has no lifecycle</li>
<li>It is self-consistent</li>
</ol>
<p>Unpacking these a bit...</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;lacks identity&rdquo; means there's no well-know identifier for this thing (e.g.
<code>row id = 12345</code>). In practical terms, it means a thing with <em>structural
equality semantics</em>. These are plentiful in F# (yay!).</li>
<li>&ldquo;no lifecycle&rdquo; means it's not data which evolves over time. Again, concretely,
this means it's <em>immutable</em>. Cool. Lots of immutable constructs in F#.</li>
<li>&ldquo;self-consistent&rdquo; means if you've got an instance of it, that instance can be
reliably assumed to contain valid (for a given domain) data. Oh, hmm... So this one doesn't
come for free. In F#, we use carefully controlled construction functions to
realize self-consistent values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, there are several ways to encode a value object in F#. The most
common are as a discriminated union or as a record. Rarely, it will be
beneficial to model the internal state of the value object as one of a set of
mutually exclusive alternatives. In that (very infrequent) case, there's clearly
only one tool for the job -- a multi-case union. However, in this post, we're
focused on <em>single-case</em> unions. And they can be used to address the most
common scenario of a value object simply wrapping one (or a few) field(s).</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Paint =
    private | Paint' of volume : float * pigment : Color

    member me.Volume =
        let (Paint' (volume=value)) = me in value

    member me.Pigment =
        let (Paint' (pigment=value)) = me in value

    // NOTE other members omitted

    static member Of(volume : float, color : string) : Result&lt;Paint, PaintError&gt; =
        // NOTE validation omitted
</code></pre>
<p>However, it's equally valid to use a <em>record</em> for this. In fact, the code is
nearly identical. The only differences being how you define and access the
underlying data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Paint =
    private { volume : float; pigment : Color }

    member me.Volume = me.volume
    member me.Pigment = me.pigment

    // NOTE other members omitted

    static member Of(volume : float, color : string) : Result&lt;Paint, PaintError&gt; =
        // NOTE validation omitted
</code></pre>
<p>In either case, the 'recipe' for a Value Object is roughly as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide between a discriminated union or a record</li>
<li>Mark constructor and field(s) <code>private</code></li>
<li>Add public construction (either by static methods or companion module)</li>
<li>Add any public read-only properties or operators (as needed)</li>
<li>Add any extra operations (either as methods or in a companion module)</li>
</ol>
<p>But why pick a union? When should you prefer a record? Honestly, this comes down
to personal preference and sense of style. Me? Personally, I prefer the record.
Performing a decomposition just to access the internal state feels... gratuitous.
But to each his own. I certainly wouldn't balk at code that chose to go with the
union approach.</p>
<p>For completeness sake, the following table lists the trade-offs between unions
and records for encoding a <em>Value Object</em> (though it's a very silly difference):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Single-case Union</th>
<th>Record</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Con:</em> Awkward access to underlying data</td>
<td><em>Pro:</em> Direct access underlying data</td>
</tr>

<aside>
<h4 id="why-lock-the-door-if-youre-gonna-leave-the-window-wide-open">Why lock the door if you're gonna leave the window wide open?!</h4>
<p>One thing I've seen (far too often) is code like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Quality =
  private { value' : byte }

  member me.Value = me.value' // ⮜ This is... not amazing  :-(

  static member Of(raw) =
    { value' = min value 50uy }
</code></pre>
<p>Personally, this seems like a big let down... especially after going through
all the trouble of avoiding the so-called &ldquo;<a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/05/25/DesignSmellPrimitiveObsession/" title="Primitive Obsession" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primitive obsession</a>&rdquo;. It
discourages consumers from thinking about the value object as a construct unto
itself. And it doesn't provide any contextual guidance around the intended
consumption of the underlying value.</p>
<p>So, how might we handle this instead?</p>
<p>Ideally, you can express behavior while never exposing the details of the
underlying data. In F#, this could be realized via a module of associated
functions, or some additional instance members, or even some <a href="https://youtu.be/Q5KO-UDx5eA" title="A Deep Dive into Active Patterns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">active patterns</a>.
In any case, this drives the consumer to think about the object itself
(rather than its implementation details).</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Quality =
  private Quality' of byte

[&lt;RequireQualifiedAccess&gt;]
module Quality =
  let MaxValue = Quality' 50uy

  let atLevel amount =
    let (Quality' limit) = MaxValue
    if amount < limit then Quality' amount else Quality.MaxValue

  let increaseBy amount (Quality' value) =
    let sum = value + amount
    let didWrap = sum &lt; value
    if didWrap then MaxValue else atLevel sum
</code></pre>
<p>Please note: the code, as shown, only works because the union and the module
are in the same &ldquo;<a href="https://fsharp.org/specs/language-spec/4.1/FSharpSpec-4.1-latest.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A473%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C69%2C769%2C0%5D"
title="F# Language Specification (latest)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">namespace declaration group</a>&rdquo;.
They both have the same immediate parent 'container' (i.e. the same module or a namespace).
Put differently, the <code>private</code> modifier, when used on records and unions, does not
mean, &ldquo;restrict to the defining type&rdquo;. Rather it means, &ldquo;restrict to the
enclosing module or namespace&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, sometimes a more generic approach is warranted. In those cases, you
can use an appropriately named function (or method), or even an explicit cast,
to stress the notion of transitioning between types. This, again, centers the
value object (from a consumer's point-of-view).</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Quality =
  private { value' : byte }

  override me.ToString() = $&quot;%02i{me.value'}&quot;

  // NOTE other behavior elided

  static member op_Explicit(quality : Quality) : int = int quality.value'

(* ... elsewhere ... *)

let quality = Quality.Of(7)
printfn $"%s{string quality}, or %i{int quality}"
</code></pre>

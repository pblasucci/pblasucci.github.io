<p>So, it's a new blog theme, and it's my first post in nearly a year (hey?! I've been busy). And it's really exciting!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
I'm thrilled that the folks at SkillsMatter are bringing the Progressive F# Tutorials back to the Big Apple for 2013. This two-day training is <em>the event</em> to attend if you have any interest what-so-ever in F#. It's not a conference. It's two days of in-depth learning. In fact, last year, my company's sister company sent one of their engineers, who had never worked with F# before, to attend the beginner track. He learned enough in two days that, upon returning to the office, he promptly re-wrote a complex piece of MatLab code into a smaller, faster, less-costly F# solution. What's more, many of the best and brightest minds in the F# community will be on-hand (some guiding. some just soaking up the knowledge). So, if you're anywhere near NYC on 18-19 September, you should attend. The official announcement follows. It contains more details, links, and a <strong>discount code</strong>. I'll see you there!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>On the back of the success of the 2013 edition, the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progressive-f-tutorials-nyc" title="Progressive F# Tutorials NYC 2013" target="_blank">Progressive F# Tutorials</a> return to New York in September - this time packing an even bigger punch! With F# UG lead Rick Minerich at the helm, we've put together a expert filled line-up - featuring Don Syme (creator of F#), Tomas Petricek, and Miguel de Icaza. The Tutorials will be split in two - a beginners track for those eager to unleash F#'s full power, and a 'meaty track' for those more experience f#pers amongst you! Each session will be a 4 hour hands-on deep dive, brushing aside the traditional format of conferences to allow you to truly immerse into the subject topic.</em></p>
<p><em>Want to get involved? We're giving a special community <b>20% discount</b>!</em></p>
<p><em>Just go ahead and enter <strong>SkillsMatter_Community</strong> on the booking form and the team at Skills Matter will look forward to welcoming you to the <strong>Progressive F# Tutorials</strong> NYC this September!</em></p></blockquote>
